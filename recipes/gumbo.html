        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
            
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
            
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            
        <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
            
        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
